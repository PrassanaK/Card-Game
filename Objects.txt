Card Game: War

- Cards -> class
    - number
    - suits (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds)
- Deck -> class
    - holds the cards -> array/lists
    - player 1 and player 2 take turns putting the top card ion the middle to compare -> if statement
        - if player 1 card is higher, player 1 gets the cards
        - else if player 2 card is higher, player 2 gets the cards
        - else if player 1 and player 2 have the same cards, go to War
        - war logic: 3 cards face down, compare the 4th cards with if statement
        - what happens with cards that are won? bottom of the array (cards in hand)? or in another array, then when no more cards in hand,
          shuffle and add to hand?
-Shuffle cards -> function, use Random function to shuffle array indexes
-War -> class
    - contains game logic
